# Engineering Principles

_Draft framework - to be refined collaboratively as the project develops_

## Core Development Philosophy

### Sophisticated Balance

Build systems that are performant yet maintainable for applications serving 200-1,000 users.

**Key Principles:**

- Choose appropriate complexity for the scale
- Optimize for developer productivity and code clarity
- Implement patterns that scale gracefully
- Balance feature richness with system simplicity

### Code Quality Standards

**TypeScript Strict Mode:**

- Enable strict type checking across all projects
- Use explicit types for public APIs
- Leverage type inference for internal implementations
- Document complex type relationships

**Consistent Patterns:**

- Establish clear architectural boundaries
- Use consistent naming conventions
- Implement standardized error handling
- Follow established project structure

**Clear Documentation:**

- Document architectural decisions
- Maintain up-to-date API documentation
- Include inline comments for complex logic
- Keep README files current and actionable

### Testing Strategy

**Unit Testing:**

- Test core business logic and utilities
- Focus on critical path functionality
- Maintain reasonable test coverage (aim for 70-80%)
- Use test-driven development for complex features

**Integration Testing:**

- Test API endpoints and database interactions
- Validate external service integrations
- Test critical user workflows
- Ensure proper error handling across boundaries

**Critical Path Testing:**

- Identify and test core user journeys
- Validate authentication and authorization flows
- Test data integrity and consistency
- Monitor performance of key operations

### Performance Goals

**For 200-1K Users:**

- Page load times under 2 seconds
- API response times under 500ms for standard operations
- Database queries optimized for expected data volumes
- Efficient caching strategies for frequently accessed data

**Monitoring:**

- Track key performance metrics
- Set up alerts for performance degradation
- Regular performance reviews and optimizations
- User experience monitoring

### Security Mindset

**Authentication & Authorization:**

- Implement secure authentication flows
- Use role-based access control where appropriate
- Validate all user inputs
- Secure session management

**Data Protection:**

- Encrypt sensitive data at rest and in transit
- Implement proper data validation and sanitization
- Follow OWASP security guidelines
- Regular security reviews and updates

**Infrastructure Security:**

- Use environment variables for secrets
- Implement proper network security
- Regular dependency updates and vulnerability scanning
- Secure deployment practices

## Development Workflow

### Code Review Process

- All code changes require review
- Focus on architecture, security, and maintainability
- Automated checks for formatting and basic quality
- Knowledge sharing through review discussions

### Deployment Strategy

- Direct to production for initial development
- Automated testing before deployment
- Database migration strategies
- Rollback procedures for critical issues

### Continuous Improvement

- Regular retrospectives on development practices
- Update principles based on project learnings
- Stay current with technology best practices
- Adapt processes as the team and project grow

_Note: These principles serve as a starting framework. They should be validated, refined, and expanded based on actual project requirements and team preferences._
