# AI Development Guide

_Draft framework - expand these principles as AI features are developed_

## Core Principles

### Model Selection

Choose appropriate models based on task complexity and cost considerations:

**Task Complexity Matching:**

- Simple text processing: Use efficient, cost-effective models
- Complex reasoning: Use more capable models when justified
- Real-time responses: Prioritize speed over maximum capability
- Batch processing: Optimize for throughput and cost

**Cost Awareness:**

- Monitor token usage across all AI interactions
- Implement usage limits and alerts
- Choose models that balance capability with cost
- Cache responses when appropriate to reduce API calls

### Prompt Engineering

**Clear, Structured Prompts:**

- Use consistent prompt templates
- Include clear instructions and context
- Provide examples for complex tasks
- Structure prompts with clear sections (context, task, format)

**Best Practices:**

- Be specific about desired output format
- Include relevant context without overwhelming the model
- Use system messages for consistent behavior
- Test prompts with edge cases and unexpected inputs

### Error Handling & Reliability

**Graceful Fallbacks:**

- Always implement fallback behavior for AI failures
- Provide meaningful error messages to users
- Log AI errors for debugging and improvement
- Never let AI failures break core application functionality

**Retry Logic:**

- Implement exponential backoff for transient failures
- Set reasonable timeout limits
- Handle rate limiting gracefully
- Distinguish between retryable and permanent errors

### Context Management

**Conversation Context:**

- Keep context focused and relevant to the task
- Implement context window management
- Clear context when switching between different tasks
- Store important context in application state, not just AI memory

**Data Privacy:**

- Never send sensitive user data to AI models without explicit consent
- Implement data anonymization where appropriate
- Follow data retention policies for AI interactions
- Be transparent about AI usage with users

### Testing & Validation

**AI Output Validation:**

- Validate AI outputs against expected formats
- Test with edge cases and unexpected inputs
- Implement content filtering for inappropriate responses
- Monitor AI output quality over time

**Testing Strategies:**

- Unit tests for AI integration functions
- Integration tests for complete AI workflows
- Performance tests for response times and throughput
- User acceptance tests for AI-powered features

### Performance & Optimization

**Response Time Optimization:**

- Stream responses when possible for better user experience
- Implement caching for frequently requested AI operations
- Use appropriate model sizes for the task complexity
- Monitor and optimize prompt length

**Resource Management:**

- Implement request queuing for high-volume scenarios
- Set appropriate concurrency limits
- Monitor API usage and costs
- Optimize batch processing when applicable

## Development Workflow

### AI Feature Development

1. Define clear success criteria for AI functionality
2. Start with simple prompts and iterate
3. Test with diverse inputs and edge cases
4. Implement proper error handling and fallbacks
5. Monitor performance and user satisfaction

### Monitoring & Improvement

- Track AI response quality metrics
- Monitor user satisfaction with AI features
- Regular review of AI costs and usage patterns
- Continuous improvement of prompts and models

### Documentation

- Document AI model choices and rationale
- Maintain prompt templates and examples
- Document fallback behaviors and error handling
- Keep track of model version changes and impacts
