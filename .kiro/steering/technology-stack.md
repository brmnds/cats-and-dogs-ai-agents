- Choose mature, well-documented technologies
- Prefer solutions with good TypeScript support
- Consider hosting costs and complexity

### Decision Framework
1. **Maturity**: Is the technology stable and well-maintained?
2. **Community**: Does it have good documentation and community support?
3. **TypeScript**: Does it have excellent TypeScript integration?
4. **Scale**: Is it appropriate for our user base and growth expectations?
5. **Team**: Does it match the team's expertise and preferences?

## To Be Defined

The following technology choices need to be made based on specific project requirements:

- **Database choice** (PostgreSQL vs MySQL vs SQLite)
- **CSS framework** (Tailwind vs CSS Modules vs Styled Components)
- **Authentication provider** (NextAuth.js vs Clerk vs custom)
- **Deployment platform** (Vercel vs AWS vs Railway)
- **Testing framework** (Vitest vs Jest)
- **Package manager** (npm vs pnpm)
