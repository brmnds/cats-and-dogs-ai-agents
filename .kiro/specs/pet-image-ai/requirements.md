# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature provides a simple web application that allows users to generate pet images and classify them using AI. The application consists of two main components: an image generation service that creates cat or dog images based on user selection, and an AI agent that identifies whether an image contains a cat or dog. When users perform classifications, they provide their name and the classification results are stored in an Aurora database alongside the user's name for tracking and analysis. The AI classification agent will be built using the Strands Agents Framework and deployed on Amazon Bedrock Agent Core. The application requires no user authentication and is designed for local development and testing.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a user, I want to generate pet images by selecting between cat or dog options, so that I can create images for testing the AI classification system.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user visits the application THEN the system SHALL display a dropdown menu with "Cat" and "Dog" options
2. WHEN the user selects an option from the dropdown THEN the system SHALL enable an image generation button
3. WHEN the user clicks the generate button THEN the system SHALL call an image generation API to create the selected pet image
4. WHEN the image generation is successful THEN the system SHALL display the generated image on the page
5. IF the image generation fails THEN the system SHALL display an appropriate error message to the user

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a user, I want to classify pet images using an AI agent and provide my name, so that I can verify whether the generated images are correctly identified as cats or dogs and have my results tracked.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN an image is displayed on the page THEN the system SHALL provide a name input field and a "Classify Image" button
2. WHEN the user enters their name and clicks the classify button THEN the system SHALL send the image to the AI classification agent
3. WHEN the AI agent processes the image THEN the system SHALL return a classification result (cat or dog) with confidence level
4. WHEN the classification is complete THEN the system SHALL display the result clearly on the page
5. WHEN the classification is successful THEN the system SHALL store the user's name, classification result, confidence score, and timestamp in the Aurora database
6. IF the classification fails THEN the system SHALL display an appropriate error message
7. WHEN the AI agent is processing THEN the system SHALL show a loading indicator to the user
8. IF the user attempts to classify without entering a name THEN the system SHALL display a validation error

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the AI classification agent built with Strands Agents Framework and deployed on Amazon Bedrock Agent Core, so that the system uses enterprise-grade AI infrastructure.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the system is deployed THEN the AI agent SHALL be implemented using Strands Agents Framework
2. WHEN the AI agent is created THEN it SHALL be deployed on Amazon Bedrock Agent Core
3. WHEN the application makes classification requests THEN it SHALL route through the Bedrock Agent endpoint
4. WHEN the agent processes images THEN it SHALL return structured responses with classification and confidence data
5. IF the Bedrock Agent is unavailable THEN the system SHALL provide appropriate error handling and user feedback

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a user, I want to access the application without any login requirements, so that I can quickly test the pet image generation and classification features.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user navigates to the application URL THEN the system SHALL display the main interface without requiring authentication
2. WHEN the application loads THEN all features SHALL be immediately accessible
3. WHEN users interact with the application THEN no session management or user tracking SHALL be required
4. WHEN the application is accessed THEN it SHALL work as a single-page application with all functionality visible

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to run and test the application on localhost, so that I can develop and debug the features before deployment.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the development server starts THEN the application SHALL be accessible on localhost
2. WHEN running locally THEN all API endpoints SHALL function correctly
3. WHEN testing locally THEN the Bedrock Agent integration SHALL work with proper AWS credentials
4. WHEN developing THEN the application SHALL support hot reloading for efficient development
5. IF AWS services are unavailable locally THEN the system SHALL provide clear error messages and fallback options

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a user, I want a clean and intuitive interface, so that I can easily understand how to generate and classify pet images.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the page loads THEN the interface SHALL clearly show the image generation and classification workflow
2. WHEN interacting with controls THEN the UI SHALL provide immediate visual feedback
3. WHEN operations are in progress THEN the system SHALL show appropriate loading states
4. WHEN results are available THEN they SHALL be displayed in a clear, readable format
5. WHEN errors occur THEN error messages SHALL be user-friendly and actionable

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want classification results stored in an Aurora database, so that I can track user interactions and analyze classification patterns.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user successfully classifies an image THEN the system SHALL store a record in the Aurora database
2. WHEN storing classification data THEN the record SHALL include user name, classification result, confidence score, image metadata, and timestamp
3. WHEN the database is unavailable THEN the system SHALL still allow classification but display a warning about data storage failure
4. WHEN storing data THEN the system SHALL handle database connection errors gracefully
5. WHEN the application starts THEN it SHALL verify database connectivity and create tables if they don't exist
