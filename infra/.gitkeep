# Infrastructure Directory

This directory contains infrastructure as code and deployment configurations.

Examples:
- `terraform/` - Terraform configurations
- `docker/` - Docker configurations
- `k8s/` - Kubernetes manifests
- `scripts/` - Deployment scripts
- `environments/` - Environment-specific configurations

Keep infrastructure code version controlled and documented.
