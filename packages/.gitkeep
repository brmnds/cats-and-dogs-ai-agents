# Packages Directory

This directory contains shared packages and libraries used across apps and services.

Examples:
- `ui/` - Shared UI components
- `utils/` - Utility functions
- `types/` - Shared TypeScript types
- `config/` - Shared configuration
- `database/` - Database schema and migrations

Each package should be reusable and have its own package.json.
